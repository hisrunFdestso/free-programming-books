The registration code for The Sims 3 version 1.0.615.00107 can be found on the back of the instruction manual that came with your game disc. You can also find it on the game case or on a sticker on the game disc itself.
 
If you have lost or misplaced your registration code, you can try contacting EA customer support and provide proof of purchase to request a new code. Alternatively, you can use a third-party program to retrieve your code from your computer's registry, but this is not recommended as it may violate the game's terms of service and expose your computer to malware.
 
Do not use codes that you find online or share your code with others, as this may result in your game being deactivated or banned by EA. Each code can only be used once and is linked to your EA account.
 
To enter your registration code, launch the game and follow the on-screen instructions. You will need an internet connection to activate your game and access online features. You can also register your game on the official Sims 3 website to access additional content and community features.
